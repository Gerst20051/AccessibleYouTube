Welcome to Accessible YouTube, an interface to YouTube designed for people who access their computers via either 2 switches or a mouse. It allows the user to use two keys/switches or a mouse to navigate through a list of videos, and watch any or all of them. Currently the list of videos can be a playlist, the results of a video search, the related videos for a particular video, or YouTube's most popular videos.
